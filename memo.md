First interview
We initially thought we want to build application for students who are seniors and are applying to colleges/ helping professor to review applications faster and provide feedback to students throughout stages of reviewing process

But after the interview, we found out that what the customer wants is to have an application to help students throughout their whole high school time to plan what to do and accomplish each year/stage of high school to get them stay on track of their goal and life. 

So we need to experience the current app(track2college) and interview others to get a better idea of our customers.
